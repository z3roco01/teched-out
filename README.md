# teched-out
A Minecraft Fabric large tech mod for 1.20.1

# Plans
- all the standard machines
- using alloys for upgrades ( no new ores )
- - dif colours of gold ( all have dif, harder compositions )
- different wire tiers ( no energy tiers, just transfer more )
- multiblock structures ? ( is there even a fabric api for this )
- 5 tiers ( low, middle, high, very high, ultra )
- progression: copper ( low ) -> gold ( middle ) -> red gold ( high ) -> green gold ( very high ) -> white gold ( ultra high )
- red gold is ~75% gold and 25% copper
- furthur alloys will prob have a dif way of making them
- electrolysis on copper ore to get copper and some silver ( real )
- green gold ( electrum ) silver x gold alloy
- white gold thru plating with silver
