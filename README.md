# teched-out
A Minecraft Fabric large tech mod for 1.20.1

# Plans
- all the standard machines
- using alloys for upgrades ( no new ores )
- - dif colours of gold ( all have dif, harder compositions )
- different wire tiers ( no energy tiers, just transfer more )
- multiblock structures ? ( is there even a fabric api for this )
- 5 tiers ( low, middle, high, very high, ultra )
- progression: copper ( low ) -> gold ( middle ) -> alloy 1 ( high ) -> alloy 2 ( very high ) -> alloy 3 ( ultra high )
